\section{Methods and validation}
\label{sec:methods-validation}
\begin{enumerate}
\item What method are you going to use?  Where does it come from: ref to the literature, paper, book(s)?
\item Why is that method(s) suitable for you problem? To what extent, and what are its limitations?
\item How are you going to validate your analysis? e.g., cross validation? Why this method?
\item You are not bound to using the methods we discuss in the course.
  If you like to use deep learning, for instance, then that's fine too.
  However, in case you want to use a method that is not part of the course, mail us (= avv or nvf) and ask whether we agree.
  (Prevent surprises at the end.)
