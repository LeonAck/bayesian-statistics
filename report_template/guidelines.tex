\subsection*{General info}
\label{sec:general}


\begin{enumerate}
\item  Students in groups of three write a report.
\item Each group has to choose a method (from the primary book, or from one of the other sourcesbelow) which the members of the group are interested in learning. A case based on a company at which one of the student is doing a master thesis would be an excellent choice.
Otherwise, the group has to find a problem on the internet with data to which to apply their method of choice.
\item Each group has to review an intermediate and near to final version of the report of an other group.
\end{enumerate}
