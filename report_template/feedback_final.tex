\section{Feedback on Final report}
\label{sec:feedb-final-report}

Review the report as if you are a customer who hired the authors for a project.
The main question is whether you are happy about your investment. You paid
\begin{equation*}
3 \times 60 h \times 50 \euro/h \approx 10 K \euro.
\end{equation*}
Is it well spent? Would you hire them again?

The rest of the feedback below is to help the authors improve their work.
Guidelines:
\begin{enumerate}
\item At most one page feedback.
\item Be respectful.
\item When reading, ensure you really understand each and every step.
\item If you particularly (dis)like certain aspects of the other's report, use that to improve your own report. Try to figure out why you (dis)like that aspect.
\item Give a grade at the end: bad, average, good, excellent  ($<4, 6, 8, 10$).
\end{enumerate}
