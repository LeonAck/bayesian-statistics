\section{Feedback on intermediate report}
\label{sec:feedb-interm-report}

Review the report as if it is a research proposal. The main question is whether you are confident about:
\begin{enumerate}
\item the relevance of the problem,
\item feasibility of answering the problem?  Is it too simple or too hard?
\item is the chosen method scientifically suitable to answer the question? How hard to you think it is to get it working?
\end{enumerate}


Guidelines:
\begin{enumerate}
\item At most one page feedback.
\item Be respectful.
  It's your job to help the authors improve their work.
  So, you give suggestions, but it's their responsibility to use them or not.
  It is not your job to solve the problems of the authors, neither to make them unhappy.
\item When reading, ensure you really understand each and every step.
\item If you particularly (dis)like certain aspects of the other's report, use that to improve your own report. Try to figure out why you (dis)like that aspect.
\item Give a grade at the end: bad, average, good, excellent  ($<4, 6, 8, 10$).
\end{enumerate}

\subsection{Problem and method}
\begin{enumerate}
\item Do you understand the problem, motivation, chosen method?
\item Include advice on what to improve, and why.
\end{enumerate}

\subsection{Style}
\label{sec:style}

\begin{enumerate}
\item Quality of writing?
\item Presentation: use of graphs and tables.
\end{enumerate}
